**Model of the interactions between three reactive chemicals on a grid using finite difference methods. This problem was taken from a past paper (paper.pdf).**

concentrations(abc).py contains the project code split into the tasks in paper.pdf.\n
periods.png shows how the concentrations change over time.\n
probabilities.png shows how the probability of two points having the same chemical in the highest concentration as a function of radial distance.
