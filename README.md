# Model of the interactions between three reactive chemicals on a grid using finite difference methods. This problem was taken from a past paper (paper.pdf).

* concentrations(abc).py contains the project code split into the tasks in paper.pdf.
* periods.png shows how the concentrations change over time.
* probabilities.png shows how the probability of two points having the same chemical in the highest concentration as a function of radial distance.
